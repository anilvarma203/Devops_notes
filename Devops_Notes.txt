Cloud Computing:
================
=>It is a process of delivering computing services(servers, databases, storage) over the internet is known as CC.

Cloud:
------
=>It is a process of accessing the data or application via internet at anytime and anywhere.
ex: Instagram, fb etc.

Vendors of cloud:
-----------------
1.AWS
2.AZURE
3.GCP
4.SALESFORCE
5.IBM etc.

TYPES of CC:
------------
1.Service Model:
  a.IAAS b.PAAS c.SAAS 

2.Deployment Model:
  a.Private b.Public c.Hybrid d.Community cloud

1.Service Model:
                       On-Premises                 IAAS                    PAAS                   SAAS

                                                Ex:Aws,Gcp etc            Ex: Godaddy            Ex:Gmail


Virtualization: creating a virtual version of something-like a server,storage,network-using software.
(or)          : running multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine, each with its own os and resources, isolated from others.
                eg: using VMware


2.Deployment Model:

public cloud                        private                     hybrid            community 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone can access            only Few people                   Both              Multiple
cost low                        cost high                       Public           Organisations
security low                   security high                      +              use same cloud
pc managed by third parties    used by organizations         Private cloud      to store their data  



AWS:(Amazon Web services)
==========================
=>It is the best cloud provider.
->It is the first among all the clouds.
->It offers multiple services on different domains.
->It is the combination of Saas,Paas,Iaas.

why Aws so popular:
-------------------
->Aws provides wide range of cloud computing services that can be used to build and run applications.
->It offers 200+ services on multiple domains.
->aws covers about 31 geographic regions around the world.
->the aws cloud spans 99 availability zones.  
->It Follows Pay As You Go, Model.
 
Data Center       :   is the actual physical servers are housed.
Availability zone :   is a phisically isolated DC within a region. It is nothing but datacenter.
Region            :   is a geographical area, that contains 2 or more AZ's.
Edge Location     :   used to cache zcontent closer to user. and used for low latency delivery of web content,videos etc.
cache             :   is the temporary storage of data to improve speed and performance.



services:
=========
1.EC2:(Elastic compute cloud) 
------
=>EC2 is a service in the aws cloud which is used to lanuch/create virtual servers on the cloud. It provides on demand,scalable computing capacity in the aws.
->These servers are used for various purposes like hosting websites,running applications,storing and managing data.

SERVER: is a computer or machine which accepts and process the requests provided by another computer and provides response.
types of servers:
a.web server b.application  c.database etc..

->To lanuch EC2 instance there will be some steps,
i.Add tags:
  -you can give name to our instance.

ii.choose an AMI(Amazon Machine Image):
   -An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration(os,applicaton server,applicatios) required to launch instance.
   -It consists of an AMI-ID which is region specific.

iii.choose an Instance type:  
    -IT means server configuration, we are providing cpu & memoryto our instance.
     ex: t2.micro, t3.micro

iv.configure your instance and network part:
   -here you need to configure all ur instance details like no.of instances,subnets(AZ),vpc etc.

v.configure security group:
   -A SG is a set of firewall rules, used to control access to the server whom you want to allow or not
   -these are region specific.
   -the port range is 0 to 65535
   -It deals with inbount and outbound traffic.
   -SG are free you can create as many u want.

vi.Add storage:
   -To store data in the server we use ebs volumes.
   -free tier upto 30gb

vii.Review and launch:
