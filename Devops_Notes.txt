Cloud Computing:
================
=>It is a process of delivering computing services(servers, databases, storage) over the internet is known as CC.

Cloud:
------
=>It is a process of accessing the data or application via internet at anytime and anywhere.
ex: Instagram, fb etc.

Virtualization: creating a virtual version of something-like a server,storage,network-using software.
(or)          : running multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine, each with its own os and resources, isolated from others.
                eg: using VMware


2.Deployment Model:

public cloud                        private                     hybrid            community 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone can access            only Few people                   Both              Multiple
cost low                        cost high                       Public           Organisations
security low                   security high                      +              use same cloud
pc managed by third parties    used by organizations         Private cloud      to store their data  



AWS:(Amazon Web services)
==========================
=>It is the best cloud provider.
->It is the first among all the clouds.
->It offers multiple services on different domains.
->It is the combination of Saas,Paas,Iaas.

why Aws so popular:
-------------------
->Aws provides wide range of cloud computing services that can be used to build and run applications.
->It offers 200+ services on multiple domains.
->aws covers about 31 geographic regions around the world.
->the aws cloud spans 99 availability zones.  
->It Follows Pay As You Go, Model.
 
Data Center       :   is the actual physical servers are housed.
Availability zone :   is a phisically isolated DC within a region. It is nothing but datacenter.
Region            :   is a geographical area, that contains 2 or more AZ's.
Edge Location     :   used to cache content closer to user. and used for low latency delivery of web content,videos etc.
cache             :   is the temporary storage of data to improve speed and performance.



services:
=========
1.EC2:(Elastic compute cloud) 
------
=>EC2 is a service in the aws cloud which is used to lanuch/create virtual servers on the cloud. It provides on demand,scalable computing capacity in the aws.
->These servers are used for various purposes like hosting websites,running applications,storing and managing data.

SERVER: is a computer or machine which accepts and process the requests provided by another computer and provides response.
types of servers:
a.web server b.application  c.database etc..

->To lanuch EC2 instance there will be some steps,
i.Add tags:
  -you can give name to our instance.

ii.choose an AMI(Amazon Machine Image):
   -An AMI is a template that contains the software configuration(os,applicaton server,applicatios) required to launch instance.
   -It consists of an AMI-ID which is region specific.

iii.choose an Instance type:  
    -IT means server configuration, we are providing cpu & memoryto our instance.
     ex: t2.micro, t3.micro

iv.configure your instance and network part:
   -here you need to configure all ur instance details like no.of instances,subnets(AZ),vpc etc.

v.configure security group:
   -A SG is a set of firewalls used to control inbound and outbound traffic for your AWS resources.whom you want to allow or not
   -these are region specific.
   -the port range is 0 to 65535
   -It deals with inbound and outbound traffic. 
   -SG are free you can create as many u want.

vi.Add storage:
   -To store data in the server we use ebs volumes.
   -free tier upto 30gb

vii.Review and launch:

Day-3:

EC2 Analysis:
----------------------
=>whenever we launch an instance in the aws it will give 2 ip address:
1.public ip: To Access the application through interent(which are running in the server)
            -It is also used to connect the instance.
            -when you start and stop instance the public ip will change.
2.private ip: To Access the application within the server.
             -ip will nit change 

=>whenver we create SG for instance we should give SSH protocal with the port number 22, to connect to the linux server(machine).
->you can also change SG after the instance creation, select the instance > click Actions >security >change sg >add sg you want >save
->You can use the same Security Group (SG) for multiple AWS EC2 instances.
                                                                                                              
=>whenvere we create a instance a volume is created with mentioned size, after creation we can modify the size of the volume once, afrer once if u want to modify again u should wait 6hrs to modify. instead of modify again and again we can create volume and we can attach it to the instance , but the volume should be created in the same availabilty zone of instance.
->You can attach and detach an Amazon EBS volume while an EC2 instance is running.

=>we can also change instance type, To modify the instance type, you must stop the instance first,  after >click on actions >instance settings >change instance type >select type >apply

=>and also we can change name tags for our instance.
